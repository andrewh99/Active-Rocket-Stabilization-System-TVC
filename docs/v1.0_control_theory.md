The flight control system utilizes a data driven characterization procedure to establish a true vertical reference, nullifying mechanical mounting misalignments between the BNO055 IMU and the airframe. By placing the vehicle on a verified level surface and streaming the gravity vector ($m/s^2$) rather than Euler angles, static errors were identified as $0.50$ for the lower axis and $-0.52$ for the upper axis. These values are implemented as software offsets within the firmware, ensuring that the proportional control loop calculates corrective action from a zeroed setpoint. This calibration is further refined by a $0.05$ deadzone to filter out sensor noise and prevent servo hunting while the vehicle is at a neutral orientation.
